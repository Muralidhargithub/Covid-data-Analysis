## Welcome to My COVID-19 Data Analysis Project!

### Overview

This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data from around the world to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic. Below are the SQL queries used in this project along with instructions on how to use them to create visualizations in Tableau.

### Instructions

1. **SQL Queries**: Copy the SQL queries provided in this SQL QUEERY, SQL QUERY1.
2. **SQL Client**: Open your preferred SQL client (e.g., Azure Data Studio, SQL Server Management Studio).
3. **Execution**: Paste the queries into your SQL client and execute them against your COVID-19 database.
4. **Data Source**: Use the query results as a data source in Tableau to create visualizations and dashboards.

### Tableau Dashboard

I'm currently working on building a Tableau dashboard using the SQL query results. This dashboard will visualize key insights and trends from the COVID-19 data. Stay tuned for updates!
